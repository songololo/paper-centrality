Street network analysis is widely used to relate urban form to land-use intensity and travel behaviour, yet ``closeness'' centrality is described and implemented inconsistently across the literature and common software, with formulas cited in papers often differing from those computed by packages such as \texttt{DepthmapX}, \texttt{Place Syntax Toolkit}, and \texttt{cityseer}. This discrepancy matters for contemporary practice, where centralities are increasingly computed in local (distance-threshold) analyses to reduce edge effects and enable multi-scale comparisons---settings in which the number of reachable nodes varies across space. This paper explains why standard mathematical closeness, and its common normalisation, can behave counter-intuitively under localised analysis, and provides an open, reproducible workflow to improve comparability across studies.

The implications are tested empirically using open street-network, land-use premises, and origin--destination travel-survey data for Madrid, Spain. Multiple closeness formulations---including classic, normalised, and \emph{Improved} variants, alongside \emph{Harmonic Closeness} and \emph{Gravity} alternatives, are computed for metric and angular distances across radii from 500m to 10km and correlated with land-use accessibility and trip volumes using Spearman rank coefficients with spatially robust (block-bootstrap) uncertainty estimates. Results show that classic closeness can yield sign reversals (strong negative associations with land-use intensity) and normalised closeness is often weakly associated, whereas \emph{Improved}, \emph{Harmonic}, and \emph{Gravity} formulations are stable and consistently positively associated across scales. The paper concludes with practical guidance: for localised street network analysis, prefer formulations that scale appropriately with varying sub-graph sizes, and clearly document the precise formulations used.

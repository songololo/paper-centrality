	abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between street centrality and densities of commercial and service activities in the city of Bologna, northern Italy. Street centrality is calibrated in a multiple centrality assessment model composed of multiple measures such as closeness, betweenness, and straightness. Kernel density estimation is used to transform datasets of centrality and activities to one scale unit for analysis of correlation between them. Results indicate that retail and service activities in Bologna tend to concentrate in areas with better centralities. The distribution of these activities correlates highly with the global betweenness of the street network, and also, to a slightly lesser extent, with the global closeness. This confirms the hypothesis that street centrality plays a crucial role in shaping the formation of urban structure and land uses.},

	abstract = {The street network is an important aspect of cities and contains crucial information about their organization and evolution. Characterizing and comparing various street networks could then be helpful for a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of these systems. Their characterization is however not easy: there are no simple tools to classify planar networks and most of the measures developed for complex networks are not useful when space is relevant. Here, we describe recent efforts in this direction and new methods adapted to spatial networks. We will first discuss measures based on the structure of shortest paths, among which the betweenness centrality. In particular for time-evolving road networks, we will show that the spatial distribution of the betweenness centrality is able to reveal the impact of important structural transformations. Shortest paths are however not the only relevant ones. In particular, they can be very different from those with the smallest number of turns?the simplest paths. The statistical comparison of the lengths of the shortest and simplest paths provides a nontrivial and nonlocal information about the spatial organization of planar graphs. We define the simplicity index as the average ratio of these lengths and the simplicity profile characterizes the simplicity at different scales. Measuring these quantities on artificial (roads, highways, railways) and natural networks (leaves, insect wings) show that there are fundamental differences?probably related to their different function?in the organization of urban and biological systems: there is a clear hierarchy of the lengths of straight lines in biological cases, but they are randomly distributed in urban systems. The paths are however not enough to fully characterize the spatial pattern of planar networks such as streets and roads. Another promising direction is to analyze the statistics of blocks of the planar network. More precisely, we can use the conditional probability distribution of the shape factor of blocks with a given area, and define what could constitute the fingerprint of a city. These fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a classification of cities based on their street patterns. This method applied on more than 130 cities in the world leads to four broad families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. This classification will be helpful for identifying dominant mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of street patterns.},

	abstract = {In modern Western societies people often lead inactive and sedentary lifestyles,  even though there is no doubt that physical activity and health are related. From an urban planning point of view it would be highly desirable to develop built environments in a way that supports people in leading more active and healthy lifestyles. Within this context there are several methods, predominantly used in the US, to measure the suitability of built environments for walking and cycling. Empirical studies show that people living in highly walkable areas are more physically active (for example, walk more or cycle more). The question is, however, whether these results are also valid for European cities given their different urban planning characteristics and infrastructure standards. To answer this question we used the Walkability-Index and the Walk Score to empirically investigate the associations between walkability and active transportation in the city of Stuttgart, Germany. In a sample of household survey data (n = 1.871) we found a noticeable relationship between walkability and active transportation-the more walkable an area was, the more active residents were. Although the statistical effect is small, the health impact might be of relevance. Being physically active is multi-determined and not only affected by the walkability of an area. We highlight these points with an excursion into research that the health and exercise sciences contribute to the topic. We propose to strengthen interdisciplinary research between the disciplines and to specifically collect data that captures the influence of the environment on physical activity in the future.},

However, we have yet to be ascertained how ?network effects? work and why angular centralities are superior to metric centralities for modeling movement in the network. The aim of this article is to clarify this issue. The investigation entailed analysis of the street network centralities and movement flows obtained through agent-based simulations conducted for two cities that differ in the pattern and size of their street networks. The findings indicate that the correlations between street network centralities and simulated movement flows, and the superiority of angular centralities in this respect, can be affected by two network's interrelated structural properties: (i) agents who calculate the shortest paths by means of metric distance pass through street segments with relatively high angular Betweenness more often than do agents who calculate the shortest paths by means of angular distance pass through street segments with a relatively high metric Betweenness; and (ii) the angular foreground sub-network (street segments in which Betweenness and Closeness values increase significantly across spatial scale) is relatively more prominent and fits the simulated movement flows better than do the metric foreground sub-networks. These structural properties are found to be nearly identical in both study cities.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an open-source Urban Network Analysis (UNA) toolbox for 
ArcGIS. The toolbox can be used to compute five types of network centrality measures on 
spatial networks: Reach; Gravity Index; Betweenness; Closeness; and Straightness. Though 
primarily developed for the analysis of urban street- and building-networks, the tools are 
equally suited for other spatial networks, such as railway networks, highway networks, or 
utility networks. Unlike previous network centrality tools that operate with two network 
elements (nodes and edges), the UNA tools include a third network element – buildings – that 
can be used as the spatial units of analysis for all measures. Two neighboring buildings on 
the same street segment can therefore obtain different accessibility results. The UNA tools 
also allow buildings to be weighted according to their particular characteristics – more 
voluminous, more populated, or otherwise more important buildings can be specified to have 
a proportionately stronger effect on the analysis outcomes, yielding more accurate and 
reliable results to any of the specified measures. The toolbox is built for easy scaling – it can 
operate on small-scale and detailed networks of dense urban areas, as well as large-scale 
regional networks. The toolbox requires ArcGIS 10 software with an ArcGIS Network Analyst 
Extension.},

	abstract = {The network metaphor in the analysis of urban and territorial cases has a long tradition, 
especially in transportation or land-use planning and economic geography. More recently, urban 
design has brought its contribution by means of the `space syntax' methodology. All these 
approachesöthough under different terms like `accessibility', `proximity', `integration' `connectivity', 
`cost', or `effort'öfocus on the idea that some places (or streets) are more important than others 
because they are more central. The study of centrality in complex systems, however, originated in 
other scientific areas, namely in structural sociology, well before its use in urban studies; moreover, as 
a structural property of the system, centrality has never been extensively investigated metrically 
in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other relational networks such 
as social, biological, or technological ones. After a previous work on some structural properties of the 
primal graph representation of urban street networks, in this paper we provide an in-depth investigation 
of centrality in the primal approach as compared with the dual one. We introduce multiple 
centrality assessment (MCA), a methodology for geographic network analysis, which is defined and 
implemented on four 1-square-mile urban street systems. MCA provides a different perspective from 
space syntax in that: (1) it is based on primal, rather than dual, street graphs; (2) it works within a 
metric, rather than topological, framework; (3) it investigates a plurality of peer centrality indices 
rather than a single index. We show that, in the MCA primal approach, much more than in the dual 
approach, some centrality indices nicely capture the `skeleton' of the urban structure that impacts 
so much on spatial cognition and collective behaviours. Moreover, the distributions of centrality in 
self-organized cities are different from those in planned cities.},

In this paper, the author considers six cases of urban street networks characterized by different patterns and historical roots. The authors propose a representation of the street networks based firstly on a primal graph, where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. In a second step, a dual graph, where streets are nodes and intersections are edges, is constructed by means of a generalization model named Intersection Continuity Negotiation, which allows to acknowledge the continuity of streets over a plurality of edges. Finally, the authors address a comparative study of some structural properties of the dual graphs, seeking significant similarities among clusters of cases. A wide set of network analysis techniques are implemented over the dual graph: in particular the authors show that the absence of any clue of assortativity differentiates urban street networks from other non-geographic systems and that most of the considered networks have a broad degree distribution typical of scale-free networks and exhibit small-world properties as well.},

Most street network models have artificial boundaries, and there are principles that can be applied to minimise or eliminate the effect of the boundary condition. However, the extent of this impact has not been systematically studied and remains little understood. In this article we present an empirical study on the impact of different network model boundaries on the results of closeness and betweenness centrality analysis of street networks. The results demonstrate that the centrality measures are affected differently by the edge effect, and that the same centrality measure is affected differently depending on the type of network distance used. These results highlight the importance, in any study of street networks, of defining the network's boundary in a way that is relevant to the research question, and of selecting appropriate analysis parameters and statistics.},

These studies investigate a wide range of phenomena using a wealth of data and diverse analytical techniques. Starting within the fields of transport or infrastructure engineering, street networks have commonly been treated as sets of more or less homogeneous linear elements, connecting locations and intersecting at junctions. This view is commonly represented as a graph, which provides a common and rigorous formalisation accessible across disciplines and is particularly well-suited for problems such as flow optimisation and routing. Street networks are, however, complex objects of investigation and the way we model and then represent them as graphs has fundamental effects on the outcomes of a study. Many approaches to modelling street networks have been proposed, each lending itself to different analyses and supporting insights into diverse aspects of the urban system. Yet, this plurality and the relation between different models remains relatively obscure and unexplored. The motivations for adopting a given model of the network are also not always clear and often seem to follow disciplinary traditions. This paper provides an overview of key street network models and the prima facie merits of pertinent alternative approaches. It suggests greater attention to consistent use of terms and concepts, of graph representations and practical applications, and concludes with suggestions for possible ways forward.},

	doi = {10.1068/b32067},
	abstract = {Axial analysis is one of the fundamental components of space syntax. The space syntax 
community has suggested that it picks up qualities of configurational relationships between spaces not 
illuminated by other representations. However, critics have questioned the absolute necessity of axial 
lines to space syntax, as well as the exact definition of axial lines. Why not another representation? 
In particular, why not road-centre lines, which are easily available in many countries for use within 
geographical information systems? Here I propose that a recently introduced method of analysis, 
angular segment analysis, can marry axial and road-centre line representations, and in doing so reflect 
a cognitive model of how route choice decisions may be made. I show that angular segment analysis 
can be applied generally to road-centre line segments or axial segments, through a simple lengthweighted 
normalisation procedure that makes values between the two maps comparable. I make 
comparative quantitative assessments for a real urban system, not just investigating angular analysis 
between axial and road-centre line networks, but also including more intuitive measures based on 
metric (or block) distances between locations. I show that the new angular segment analysis algorithm 
produces better correlation with observed vehicular flow than both standard axial analysis and 
metric distance measures. The results imply that there is no reason why space syntax inspired 
measures cannot be combined with transportation network analysis representations in order to create 
a new, cognitively coherent, model of movement in the city.},

	abstract = {Route choice within transportation network analysis is generally assumed to correspond to a utility function. Although cognitive factors are known to affect this function, most route choice models assume that minimum time or distance are the primary elements affecting the chosen path. However, evidence from cognitive science suggests that the number and angle of turns during a pedestrian journey affects the perception of its length. Does this distorted estimation affect drivers' route choice? In this paper, we build a model which assumes drivers will try to take the minimum angular path rather than the more usual minimum block-distance path. In order to concentrate on the cognitive choices involved, we use a simplified model. We form a network from standard road-center line data. The lines comprising the network are treated as a graph, where each straight-line segment acts as a node, and the edge -weight to any other segment is the angular turn to it from the current segment. To allocate trips, every segment is treated as a both a possible origin and a possible destination, and we assume the shortest angular path between the two is followed. This allows us to use the standard graph measure of betweenness to act as an approximation of relative vehicular flow through segments. We validate the model against daily traffic-flow rates collected for a small region of London in a previous study. We find that the minimum angular path model correlates strongly with observed traffic flows, and that it significantly outperforms a minimum block-distance model.},

	url = {http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk},
	abstract = {This paper presents a method for the quantification of a spatial layout for the purposes of prediction of movement through or occupancy of the space. We call this method the 'angular analysis' of the space. The method itself is straightforward and simply embodies the combination of two ideas. Firstly, the prediction that if a body, e.g., a person or means of transportation such as a car or a ship, is to travel from point A to point B, then it will attempt to turn as little as possible (rather than the more usual assumption that it will try to follow the shortest path between A and B). Secondly, that any point in the considered space can be a start or an end point to a journey, and any journey from any start to any end point is equally likely as any other journey. The combination of these two ideas is used as a basis for quantification of points within the space. This paper shows how these ideas are linked intrinsically with the notion of ‘space syntax' as proposed by Hillier and Hanson 1984 and later Hillier 1996, and other methods currently used for similar purposes. We give formal definitions of angular analysis methods and demonstration algorithms for the calculation. The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we very briefly outline the context of the angular analysis method within methods of prediction and simulation of movement and occupancy. Section 3 introduces the key concepts of angular analysis, while section 4 considers its position relative to other methods, looking in more detail at how it relates to space syntax, gravity modelling and autonomous agents. Section 5 discusses the mathematical detail for the metrics that will constitute angular analysis, and section 6 looks at methods for implementing the analysis. Finally, some concluding remarks are given in section 7.},

The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units. Given that such analyses can only be expected to increase with the imminent availability of new census data both in the United Kingdom and in the USA, and the current proliferation of GIS (geographical information system) technology which permits even more access to aggregated data, this paper serves as a topical warning.},

	abstract = {There is an epistemological divide in the field of road network analysis, concerning the way network distance should be conceptualized. On one hand, the generality of studies in the field adopt metric distance as a self-evident choice. On the other, space syntax studies adopt a different distance concept, namely that of angular distance, which ignores actual physical lengths. Theoretically, these two distance concepts imply quite different assumptions. Analytically, they produce also different results. In this paper we assess the differences between these two network distance concepts, using a model of the UK's complete road network (2,031,971 nodes) and a very large dataset of vehicular movement counts (20,752 locations). We describe the statistical associations between observed vehicular flows and the betweenness centrality of the road-network nodes where such flows were measured, the latter calculated with metric and angular distance functions, across a number of increasing radii. Relations to road capacity are also discussed in principal roads where this is known. The geographical comprehensiveness of our model and the size of our movement sample allow us to state, with unprecedented statistical validity, the clear outperformance of angular distance over metric distance, in what concerns the strength of the studied correlations. This is true for all types of roads (urban and non-urban) and for all motorized vehicles, representing 99.05\% of the total traffic; the remaining 0.95\% correspond to pedal cycles, which yielded inconclusive results. We also demonstrate the existence of two distinct regimes of association between movement and centrality, conspicuous in cities but altogether absent in non-urban areas, which represent new evidence supporting space syntax's dual model of urban form.},

	abstract = {Closeness and betweenness are forms of spatial network analysis grounded in a long-standing tradition of measuring accessibility and flow potential. More recently, these measures have been enhanced by the concept of spatial localization, producing effec-tive models for the prediction of pedestrian and vehicle driver behaviour. A contradiction arises where the distance metric used to define locality does not match the distance metric used to define shortest paths for closeness and betweenness. A typical case is the use of angular shortest paths within a Euclidean buffer as a pedestrian flow model. Such a model assumes that people make a mode choice based on distance, but a route choice based on least angular change – even when this results in an excessively long 'problem route', which conflicts with their criterion for mode choice. This study examines the prevalence of problem routes and the magnitude of their effect on some pedestrian and vehicle models. We show that while in a weighted analysis, pathological cases could invalidate an entire model, in the models presented the effect of this contradiction is minor. We do this by comparing model predictions to real flow data, using four strategies for handling problem routes: ignore, discard, reroute and strict locality. Strict locality is justified on the grounds of bounded rationality. We find all strategies to give broadly similar results, although the reroute and strict strategies give marginally better simulation accuracy. We also present a discussion of the characteristics of each strategy, and findings on computational efficiency. We conclude that it is prudent in any computation of localized closeness and betweenness to consider the impact of problem routes; however, they do not necessa-rily invalidate these forms of analysis, which remain useful.},

	title = {What can typology explain that configuration can not?},
	abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of the relation between space syntax and the adjacent field of urban morphology. We believe that this can benefit both fields in their further development and more specifically, this paper will show how typical approaches in urban morphology can be helpful in explaining variations in correlations between space syntax measures and pedestrian movement. That these correlations vary is shown by various scholars and the reoccurring argument is missing data input such as, amongst others, density, land use and public transport. We also see a problem in space syntax analysis in that there seems to be little consistency in exactly how pedestrian movement is best captured, that is, with what measure and at which radius. Hillier and Iida (2005) show for instance in their study of four London areas that the 'best radius' can be found with a radius of analysis varying from 12 to 102 segments. This is troublesome, especially if we are not able to explain why this is the case. In this paper we propose to use two typo-morphological approaches to explain such variations: the classification system for street morphologies developed by Marshall (2005) and the integrated density approach 'Spacemate' developed by Berghauser Pont and Haupt (2009; 2010). The results presented in this paper show that different neighbourhood types, in terms of density and street morphology, indeed have different patterns driving pedestrian behaviour and following that, ask for tailored spatial analysis. It is shown that in denser and more 'griddy' street patterns, the betweenness centrality measure is able to capture pedestrian behaviour, but in other neighbourhood types pedestrian behaviour is better captured when also closeness centrality and the distribution of attractions is included. Further, it is shown that what may be called the 'scale of operation' of each neighbourhood plays a crucial role which needs to be considered when choosing the radius of analysis. This paper shows further that a first indication of pedestrian intensity and pedestrian distribution can be arrived at by using two relative simple spatial measures: 'accessible density' and 'attraction betweenness' respectively. Although this study is just a first tentative exploration in combining urban morphology with space syntax, we suggest that we based on these preliminary results can see many advantages in pursuing research in this direction.},

	abstract = {We explore ways of introducing Euclidean distances associated with street systems represented by axial lines into the two connectivity graphs based on points (or street junctions), and on lines (or streets), the so-called dual and primal representations of the space syntax problem. As the axial line is embedded in the connectivity graph between the points, for the dual problem the specification of Euclidean distance between points is relatively trivial but for the original syntax problem, this is problematic in that it requires us to find a unique point representation for each line. The key is to find the centroids of the lines (of sight or unobstructed movement) between the points on each axial line, and then to use these to form a weighted centroid of centroids. The distances between axial lines which form paths through the connectivity graph between streets, are then computed using these centroids as starting points for each line and routing distance through the street junctions. There are many issues involving interpretation of these measures. It might be thought that the longer an axial line, the more important it is. But by giving an axial line distance, this suggests that this is a deterrence to interaction, as in spatial interaction theory, with longer axial lines being individually less important, notwithstanding the probability that they are better connected within the overall street system. Clearly in many finer-scale morphologies, this assumption might not be tenable but the measures developed here can be easily adapted to various circumstances. What this focus on distance enables us to do is to treat a ‘mixed syntax’ problem where we are able to embed truly planar graphs into the axial map. This extends the technique to deal with systems not only comprising streets down which we can see, but also fixed rail lines, subway systems, footpaths and so on which currently are hard to handle in the traditional theory. We illustrate the extended theory for a pure syntax problem, the French village of Gassin, and a mixed syntax problem based on the grid of streets and underground railways in central Melbourne. In conclusion, we introduce the notion that proximity or adjacency at different orders might form more appropriate measures of syntax distance, the proximity of nodes to nodes and lines to lines in the dual and the primal being illustrated for both Gassin and central Melbourne.},

	abstract = {The prevailing terminological confusion around the concept `diversity' has hampered accurate communication and caused diversity issues to appear unnecessarily complicated. In fact, a consistent terminology for phenomena related to (species) diversity is already available. When this terminology is adhered to, diversity emerges as an easily understood concept. It is important to differentiate between diversity itself and a diversity index: an index of something is just a surrogate for the thing itself. The conceptual problem of defining diversity also has to be separated from the practical problem of deciding how to adequately quantify diversity for a community of interest. In practice, diversity can be quantified for any dataset where units of observation (such as individuals) have been classified into types (such as species). All that needs to be known is what proportion of the observed units belong to a type of mean abundance. Diversity equals the inverse of this mean, and it quantifies the effective number of the types of interest. In ecology, interest often (but not always) focuses on species diversity. If the dataset consists of (or gets divided into) subunits, then the total effective number of species (gamma diversity) can be partitioned into the effective number of compositionally distinct subunits (beta diversity) and the mean effective number of species per such subunit (alpha diversity). Species richness is related to species diversity, but they are not the same thing; richness does not take the proportional abundances into account and is therefore the actual—rather than the effective—number of types. Most of the phenomena that have been called `beta diversity' in the past do not quantify an effective number of types, so they should be referred to by names other than `diversity' (for example, species turnover or differentiation).},

We measure these metrics on artificial (roads, highways, railways) and natural networks (leaves, slime mould, insect wings) and show that there are fundamental differences in the organization of urban and biological systems, related to their function, navigation or distribution: straight lines are organized hierarchically in biological cases, and have random lengths and locations in urban systems.

	title = {Configurational modelling of urban movement networks},
	volume = {25},
	abstract = {Transportation research has usually seen road networks as inert systems to be navigated and eventually filled up by traffic. A new type of 'configurational' road network modelling, coupled to detailed studies of vehicular and pedestrian flows, has shown that road networks have a much more constructive role. They strongly influence the pattern of flows through quantifiable properties of the network 'configuration'. Recent research results are presented showing that rates of vehicular move-ment in road segments are to a greater extent than previously realised the direct outcome of the location of those segments in the network configuration as a whole and that this is the case especially in the fine structure of the urban grid. A supply and demand model of urban movement is proposed in which the degree to which a street alignment is on simplest routes between all other pairs of alignments in the system determines the demand side of the equation, and the effective road width available to traffic determines the supply side. Regression analysis shows that these two factors alone account for the majority of the variance in flows from street to street (r 2 {\textasciitilde} 0.8). A model is then proposed of the evolution of the city in allocation of land uses to land parcels, and the allocation of capacity in the road network, where each reinforces the underlaying configurational logic through a feedback 'multiplier' effect. These findings suggest the possibility of using urban design parameters, such as the plan configuration of the street grid, building height, and street width, to arrive at a better controlled relationship between vehicles and pedestrians in urban areas. As these design parameters are under the direct control of the urban master-planner, the new techniques lend themselves to application in design decision support. A case example of the application of these techniques in the master-planning of the redevelopment of London's South Bank cultural centre is presented.},

Moreover, it can be computed for any metrical network and not only for the topological cases.

For example, how far will pedestrians travel to access different types of destinations? How to know if the " one quarter mile assumption " that is often bantered about is reliable? How far will bicyclists travel to cycle on a bicycle only facility? How far do people drive for their common retail needs? To examine these questions, this research makes use of available travel survey data for the Twin Cities region. A primary outcome of this research is to examine different types of destinations and accurately and robustly estimate distance decay models for auto and non-auto travel modes, and also to comment on its applicability for: (a) different types of travel, and (b) development of accessibility measures that incorporate this information.},

	abstract = {Research on urban form and walkability suggests that on average smaller blocks are better for pedestrians. We explore how block sizes, plot dimensions and street widths affect pedestrian accessibility in regular grids. Pedestrian accessibility is captured by the gravity index, which is proportional to the number of neighbouring plots that can be reached within a given walking radius and inversely proportional to the travel costs involved. Pedestrian accessibility is measured for the original town plans of well-known US and Australian grids and compared with thousands of computer simulated grids, analysing how close the grids come to the theoretical maxima of pedestrian accessibility, given plot sizes and street dimensions. The findings show how dimensions of plot frontages and depths, street widths and block lengths affect pedestrian accessibility in gridiron urban environments. Block lengths have a non-linear relationship to accessibility and smaller blocks are not necessarily better for pedestrians. In many cases, larger blocks have greater pedestrian accessibility than smaller blocks, which might explain previous variable findings on the effects of blocks sizes on walkability. Though block lengths in most of the famous grids we investigate come close to achieving maximum possible pedestrian accessibility levels, some of them could provide users with as much as 12 per cent more accessibility if their lengths were optimized for pedestrians. The lengths of the Manhattan and Indianapolis blocks come closest to maximizing pedestrian access, given their original plot and street dimensions. We illustrate a few prototypical block sizes that maximize pedestrian accessibility and may be suitable for pedestrian-friendly subdivisions in contemporary urban planning.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on a number of inconsistencies that appear in space syntaxöa well-known 
technique of urban analysisöwhen dealing with certain geometrical configurations. At a simple level, 
the analysis of regularly gridded urban textures (such as Manhattan's) reveals the difficulty of accepting 
the claim that space syntax allows the modelling of pedestrian choice making. In more complex 
cases, the distortion of two ideal textures produces a topological discontinuity, leading to the 
unacceptable situation where one single urban configuration produces two conflicting outcomes 
when analysed with space syntax tools. Several other points are also discussed, such as the difficulty 
of space syntax to take into account building height and land use, and its sensitivity to boundary 
conditions. Conclusions seem to suggest that the topological representation of cities, on which space 
syntax is based, discards precious metric information and is rather limiting. It is envisaged that with 
current increases in computational power new algorithms might allow a deeper understanding of 
urban texture, based on the full exploration of its metric and topological properties. This would 
contribute to answer the fascinating question which space syntax has helped to frame: what is the 
influence of urban configuration on social life?},

The study uses the dataset from Penn et al. (1998) and Hillier and Iida (2005), for comparison and validation, where the new angular betweenness centrality proposed, that derives from a graph-search agent idea, performs faster with similar explanatory power on pedestrian movement than the space syntax depthmapX implementation which uses cognitive-search-agent. Finally the findings, which show that a graph-search agent may be better relate to manifestations of spatial perception, such as way-finding and pedestrian movement, reveals the need for further exploration of the underlying similarities and differences of angular betweenness using graph-search agent and cognitive-search-agent in relation to observed pedestrian behaviour.},

In this work, we present a novel robustness analysis, based on the interaction between the primal and the dual transportation layer for two large metropolises, London and Chicago, thus considering the structural differences to intentional attacks for self-organized and planned cities. We elaborate the results through an accurate closeness centrality analysis in the Euclidean space and in the relationship between primal and dual space. Interestingly enough, we find that even if the considered planar graphs display very distinct properties, the information space induce them to converge toward systems which are similar in terms of transportation properties.},

In this paper, accessibility measures are classified according to their underpinning theories, complexity in constructions, and demand on data. The classifications comprise travel-cost, gravity, constraints-based, utility-based, and composite approaches. While simpler models are less demanding on data, they fail to address the subject in a theoretically rigorous manner. The paper also summarizes issues that are important in modeling accessibility.

These are observed as administrative regional delimitations which are the outcome of complex geographical, political and historical processes which leave almost indelible footprints on infrastructure such as the street network. In this work, we uncover a set of hierarchies in Britain at different scales using percolation theory on the street network and on its intersections which are the primary points of interaction and urban agglomeration. At the larger scales, the observed hierarchical structures can be interpreted as regional fractures of Britain, observed in various forms, from natural boundaries, such as National Parks, to regional divisions based on social class and wealth such as the well-known North– South divide. At smaller scales, cities are generated through recursive percolations on each of the emerging regional clusters. We examine the evolution of the morphology of the system as a whole, by measuring the fractal dimension of the clusters at each distance threshold in the percolation. We observe that this reaches a maximum plateau at a specific distance. The clusters defined at this distance threshold are in excellent correspondence with the boundaries of cities recovered from satellite images, and from previous methods using population density.},

Address data come from the YMCA-Harvard After School Food and Fitness Project, an obesity prevention intervention involving children aged 5–11 years and their families participating in YMCA-administered, after-school programs located in four geographically diverse metropolitan areas in the US (n = 733). GIS data were used to measure multiple objective indicators of neighborhood walkability. Walk Scores were also obtained for the participant's residential addresses. Spearman correlations between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators were calculated as well as Spearman correlations accounting for spatial autocorrelation. There were many significant moderate correlations OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2011, 8 4161 between Walk Scores and the GIS neighborhood walkability indicators such as density of retail destinations and intersection density (p {\textless} 0.05).

Walk Score ® is free and publicly available for public health researchers and practitioners. Results from our study suggest that Walk Score ® is a valid measure of estimating certain aspects of neighborhood walkability, particularly at the 1600-meter buffer. As such, our study confirms and extends the generalizability of previous findings demonstrating that Walk Score is a valid measure of estimating neighborhood walkability in multiple geographic locations and at multiple spatial scales.},

It has focused attention of urban researchers onto the importance of the relations between the sociality and spatiality of the city. The primary methods of syntactic analysis involve a reduction of urban morphology to a set of spatial axes; here, we explore some limits to such analysis for urban design. Topological analysis of axial models has long recognized problems in accounting for distance, scale and sinuous streetscapes. Existing adaptations to axial methods that address such problems are modelled and shown to produce a broad range of results for the same urban morphology. In each case, we also compare different capacities for to-movement and through-movement – the distinction between ‘closeness centrality’ and ‘betweenness centrality’ that shows that network integration is multiple. We argue that axial analyses privilege visibility over accessibility and can produce distorted mapping at walkable scales; only one of the methods tested measures permeability and walkable access. Space syntax analysis is a powerful tool that will be more useful the better such limits are understood.},

	abstract = {Pedestrian accessibility has been growing in importance as an urban planning objective. Assessing it with gravity-based or potential accessibility measures requires the selection of an impedance function in order to reflect the friction of distance. The choice of impedance function is crucial to pedestrian accessibility assessment due to the level of spatial data detail required and also because perceived distances differ from physical distances. Here, we measure and compare 20 gravity-based measures, varying the impedance function and associated parameters. Correlation analysis revealed a significant and strong correlation between the measures. Factor analysis extracted two groups of measures, differing mainly in their maximum cutoff travel distance, i.e. the distance at which the impedance function reaches zero. Spatial analysis revealed that all measures produce similar spatial results in terms of identifying high and low accessibility locations but different values for medium accessibility locations. Places located at between 200 and 400 m from an opportunity are especially sensitive to the impedance function used. We promote a cumulative–Gaussian approach to measure pedestrian accessibility, as it explicitly includes the travel tolerance concept and we found it to be the most robust measure in terms of data variability.},

	title = {Road centre line simplification principles for angular segment analysis},
	abstract = {Angular segment analysis is one of the most fundamental analyses in space syntax practice that helps understand movement, land-use and other socio-economic patterns. It was initially applied in axial segment maps and later was used in road centre line maps as an attempt to overcome the 'segment problem' (Turner, 2005). Furthermore, the growing need to examine large urban systems has led to the wide use of road centre line maps instead of the previously hand-drawn axial maps. However, this transition to such datasets has lacked systematic studies on what is required to convert a road centre line map into a segment map, in order to produce reliable results of the angular segment analysis. To date, no consensual methodology has been developed within the space syntax community. This paper attempts to clarify what a road centre line segment represents spatially and suggests principles and rules to simplify a road centre line map to a segment map. Based on previous experience, the simplification mostly relies on the following two principles: reducing the number of nodes in the dual graph representation of a street network; optimising the angular change between adjacent nodes of the dual graph when space allows it. In addition to the above general principles, we discuss rules for special and complex cases, e.g. roundabouts, underpasses, bridges etc. To evaluate these rules and principles comparisons are carried out between traditional axial and RCL unsimplified and simplified segment maps, to develop a good understanding of how changes in dual graph representation of a street network can affect space syntax measure of 'choice'. Correlations of angular segment choice values are performed in order to evaluate which simplification technique can approximate better the axial representation of actual human activity. The results show that using a raw road centre line data set raises several inconsistencies in the analysis results, and the progressive application of the different simplification techniques brings these results closer to those of a traditional axial segment map, and thus to a better representation of socio-economic activity. The purpose of simplification is to minimise inconsistencies to ensure maximum accuracy in the results of angular segment analysis.},

	title = {Employing volunteered geographic information in space syntax analysis},
	abstract = {The application of volunteered geographic information has rapidly increased over the past years. OpenStreetMap (OSM) forms in this context one of the most ambitious and promising projects, providing consistent global coverage of street network information. With a constantly growing number of participants and the implementation of governmental and proprietary based information is a complete coverage of global street networks within reach. The data allows comparative cross-country analyses and any method developed within its framework are transferable to other cases. This makes OSM a powerful and desirable data source for applied network analyses, such as space syntax. However, OSM data does not come without obstacles. Inconsistent representation of space, topological fragmentation and accuracy are just some of the problems that one faces when employing OSM data. In fact, without prior processing and simplification of the network, results differ significantly between case studies. This paper presents a method for OSM data set simplification as well as the theoretical and analytical reasoning behind it. The simplification is done by a series of ArcGIS workflows and algorithms. The outcome of this process is compared to an angular segment analysis (ASA) of a segment model, an Integrated Transport Network (ITN) Ordnance Survey data model and an OSM street network data model. The results show that a simplified version of OSM data is highly comparable to a segmented axial line representation and that such data sets constitute an appropriate alternative for situations where segment maps are not available, such as complex, large-scale regional models and cross-country comparisons. The simplification workflow is transferable to other cases and data sets and helps overcoming common problems while significantly improving computational time needed in the process.},

	abstract = {cityseer-api is a Python package consisting of computational tools for fine-grained street-network and land-use analysis, helpful in assessing the morphological precursors to vibrant neighbourhoods. It is underpinned by network-based methods developed specifically for urban analysis at the pedestrian scale. cityseer-api computes a variety of node and segment-based network centrality methods, land-use accessibility and mixed-use measures, and statistical aggregations. Accessibilities and aggregations are computed dynamically over the street-network while taking walking distance thresholds and the direction of approach into account, and can optionally incorporate spatial impedances and network decomposition to increase spatial precision. The use of Python facilitates compatibility with popular computational tools for network manipulation (NetworkX), geospatial topology (shapely), geospatial data state management (GeoPandas), and the NumPy stack of scientific packages. The provision of robust network cleaning tools aids the use of OpenStreetMap data for network analysis. Underlying loop-intensive algorithms are implemented in Numba JIT compiled code so that the methods scale efficiently to larger cities and regions. Online documentation is available from cityseer.benchmarkurbanism.com, and the Github repository is available at github.com/benchmark-urbanism/cityseer.

	abstract = {Centrality has revealed crucial for understanding the structural properties of complex relational networks. Centrality is also relevant for various spatial factors affecting human life and behaviors in cities. Here, we present a comprehensive study of centrality distributions over geographic networks of urban streets. Five different measures of centrality, namely degree, closeness, betweenness, straightness and information, are compared over 18 1-square-mile samples of different world cities. Samples are represented by primal geographic graphs, i.e., valued graphs defined by metric rather than topologic distance where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. The spatial behavior of centrality indices over the networks is investigated graphically by means of color-coded maps. The results indicate that a spatial analysis, that we term multiple centrality assessment, grounded not on a single but on a set of different centrality indices, allows an extended comprehension of the city structure, nicely capturing the skeleton of most central routes and subareas that so much impacts on spatial cognition and on collective dynamical behaviors. Statistically, closeness, straightness and betweenness turn out to follow similar functional distribution in all cases, despite the extreme diversity of the considered cities. Conversely, information is found to be exponential in planned cities and to follow a power-law scaling in self-organized cities. Hierarchical clustering analysis, based either on the Gini coefficients of the centrality distributions, or on the correlation between different centrality measures, is able to characterize classes of cities.},

HIGHLIGHTS

• Closeness centrality formulas cited in papers differ from software outputs

• Classic closeness produces sign reversals under localised network analysis

• Normalised closeness shows weak associations with land-use intensity

• Improved and Harmonic Closeness yield stable positive associations

• Open code and data enable reproducibility and methodological comparison
